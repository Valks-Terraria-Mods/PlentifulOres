[h1]Never miss that particular ore you're searching for ever again[/h1]
Ore spawns are roughly 5x more frequent with default settings. Ores that are effected are listed below. The mod is only triggered on world creation. Only copper spawns in a copper world, likewise tin only spawns in a world with tin.

[h1]Effected Ores[/h1]
All vanilla pre-hardmode ores and gems

Killing the Wall of Flesh will now spawn a ton of hardmode ores everywhere. The hardmode ores will always be cobalt, mythril and titanium.

[h1]Config Explained[/h1]
- Near Surface (ores will spawn near surface)
- Not Only Replace But Add (ores will be placed in empty tiles)
- No Y Change (have not tested but here for you to experiment)
- Override (I think this makes it so ores replace existing tiles)
- Speed X (have not tested but here for you to experiment)
- Speed Y (have not tested but here for you to experiment)
- Additional Strength (increases the size of ore clusters)
- Additional Steps (like strength but different!)
- All Ore and Gem Bias (changes how much a particular ore or gem spawns)
